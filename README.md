# Brain Agriculture Case

This project is a React application and is part of the Brain Agriculture evaluation case.
Solutions were applied to the problems proposed in the repository challenge - [brain-agriculture](https://github.com/brain-ag/trabalhe-conosco). For this, I used:

- Programming logic, observing business rules;
- Data manipulation and processing;
- Maintaining application state with the React Context API;
- Memorizing functions, expensive calculations and components;
- Form management in React;

### Let's start?

To test the application, make sure you have Node.js and Git installed.

Open your terminal and clone the repository to your machine:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/gabrielucas/brain-agriculture.git
```
```
cd brain-agriculture/ && code .
```
Run the `yarn` command to install all dependencies.

### Starting the application

To start the application, run the command `yarn dev`.

This application was built with Vite. To view it in your browser, go to (http://localhost:5173/). If you want to view the mobile experience, on your phone, run `yarn dev --host` to expose your IP address.

 *Note: remember that you must have your cell phone connected to the same network as your machine for the IP to be visible to your device.*

 On your device, open the browser and access the address (http://your-ip-address:5173).

 **Now it's up to you. Feel free to explore the application's features**
